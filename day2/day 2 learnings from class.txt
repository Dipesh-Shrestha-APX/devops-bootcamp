#) Research and Automation Metrics:

deployment frequency: code to production
lead time for change: time for commit to prod
Mean time to recovery: Monitoring strength, SLA, SLO 
Change failure rate: deployment errors || issue with testing principles and compliances

#) Documentation how to do it:

CASE Study type of documentation
	need: to make stakeholders understand the high level overview
	1) intro
	2) problem statement: why this case study is done
	3) the solution: 
		arch diagram
			flow description
	4) key metrices
	5) TCO(total cost optimization) analysis
	6) conclusion


bugs and patching

tree to see the hierarchy

##) basics:
------------
ls cd mkdir rm cp mv 
cat less head tail 
find grep which 
ps top kill 
ping curl wget netstat


zsh: autocomplete autocorrect repos implementation

*) real time logs:
	tail -f /var/log/a.log
	how many  to watch and such

ps aux
htop top >> to watch the cpu and processes
ping 
	>> it allows the ping only when the icmp port 
	is allowed on the destination 

curl	>> can send http request to the apis and such
wget	>> download
find	>> to find files in the folder recursively
 e.g. find devops/ -name "*.log"

telnet >> to test connectivity to specific ports
	telnet ip_address port_no

hardlink and softlink to files
	ll for softlink 
		sym links created

ec2 ppk pem file 400 permission

mostly secrets is given 600


!!!!
for the html of /var/www/html
chown www-data:www-data is only given likewise for the nginx
