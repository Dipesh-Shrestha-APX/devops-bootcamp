1) deployment frequency:
 total_deployments_in_month/working_days_in_month

 40/20 = 2

2) lead time for changes
  = 3 hours (given as time from commit to production as average)

3) change failure rate
 =  failure/total deploy *100%
  6/40*100 = 15%

4) MTTR (mean time to recover)
= Sum of total time to recover/ no. of times recovery occurred
= 90+45+120+240+30+240 mins/6 = 127.5mins

5) dora guidelines 
more than 1 deployment per day : elite
lead time for change < day
: elite
change failure rate <= 15%
: elite
mttr = 127.5 mins = 2 hr 7.5 mins
