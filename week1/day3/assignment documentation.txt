first of all i switched to root to avoid giving password all the time

TASK 1

1)to create the user i used
=> 
useradd ram
useradd hari
useradd gita

2)to create two groups
groupadd devteam
groupadd deployers

3)add users to group
usermod -aG devteam ram
usermod -aG devteam hari
usermod -aG devteam gita
usermod -aG deployers deploy

TASK 2:
1) to create directory
2) to create subdirectories
mkdir -p /var/www/project/source
mkdir -p /var/www/project/logs
mkdir -p /var/www/project/scripts
mkdir -p /var/www/project/shared

TASK 3:
1) set permission :
 -only members of devteam to enter and modify source/
 -group ownership and sgid for inherits
 -umask every member of devteam with 002

 chgrp devteam source
 chmod 770 source
 ------------
 chmod g+s source
 ----------------
 cd /etc/profile.d 
 vi devteam-umask.sh 
  ===
    if id -nG "$USER" | grep -qw "devteam"; then umask 002
    fi 

----------------------
2) logs 
-everyone in devteam can append
-no can delete or modigy other's logs - sticky bit

chgrp devteam logs
chmod 775 logs
--------------
chmod o+t logs
 
 3) root created deploy.sh in scripts folders only to be executed by the deploy user

 I did the solution of using the ACLs
 i found the linux doesn't allow to run shell scripts posing as the root so the 
 suid is useless (used the ACLs the umask didn't work cause changign /etc/.bashrc is global and changing ~/.bashrc is user specific needed ACLs for the group one)

 setfacl -m u:deploy:rw deploy.sh
  there is need to read the lines of the script and execute so this is done 

  4) shared folder 
  all devteam can read and write 
  setgid fo this to devteam as well

  chgrp devteam shared
  chmod 775 shared
  -----
  chmod g+s shared

TASK 4

1 devteam members auto umask when login already done in task 3.1

TASK 5
testing
  ram can create in shared folder and 
  folder and file will have ownership of devteam group and permission on them will be 664 and 775 =

  found:: TRUE

---
 gita can't delete file created by ram in logs:

  found :: TRUE

----
 user deploy can execute the deploy.sh despite not being owner:


 found :: TRUE 
 using ACLs the linux doesnt allow the users to pose as the root to execute the shell scripts
